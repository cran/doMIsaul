Description: Algorithms for (i) unsupervised learning for dataset with
    missing data and/or left-censored data, using multiple imputation and
    consensus clustering ; (ii) semi-supervised learning with a survival
    endpoint (right-censored) for complete or incomplete datasets, using
    multiple imputation and consensus clustering in the latter case. The
    methods are described in Faucheux et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1002/bimj.201900366> and Faucheux et al. (2021)
    <doi:10.1002/bimj.202000365>, respectively.
